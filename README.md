# Medical_appointment_noshow
# Overview
This project aims at predicting if people show up for their medical appointments or not. It is important for the understanding of patients' behaviour and their reasons for not showing up for their scheduled medical appointments. I chose this project because I have seen many doctors and hospital staffs suffer with the issue of rescheduling and cancelling appointments. It kills a lot of their time and energy. With this analysis, I feel it would be easy for them to schedule appointments keeping in mind the patients' behaviour.
# Note
As this was only an exploratory analysis, many potential correlations may remain uncovered. The data should be investigated further with more advanced statistical analysis to potentially reveal new insights and correlations.
