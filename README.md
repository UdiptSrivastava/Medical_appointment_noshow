# Medical_appointment_noshow
# Overview
This project aims at predicting if people show up for their medical appointments or not. It is important for the understanding of patients' behaviour and their reasons for not showing up for their scheduled medical appointments. I chose this project because I have seen many doctors and hospital staffs suffer with the issue of rescheduling and cancelling appointments. It kills a lot of their time and energy. With this analysis, I feel it would be easy for them to schedule appointments keeping in mind the patients' behaviour.
# Details
I have looked into the dataset and managed a few problems like unifying names, removing wrong data, adding new features based on existing data. I have also investigated most of independent variables in the dataset and made a few observations comparing them to each other as well as to the dependent one (no_show). As this was only an exploratory analysis, many potential correlations may remain uncovered. The data should be investigated further with more advanced statistical analysis to potentially reveal new insights and correlations.
